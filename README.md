# DVD Rental Database - PostgreSQL SQL Scripts

Welcome to the DVD Rental Database repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL scripts and queries that I've created while learning PostgreSQL using the DVD rental dataset. These scripts cover various aspects of database operations and data analysis.

## About the Dataset

The DVD rental dataset is a widely-used sample database in the PostgreSQL community. It simulates a DVD rental store's database, containing tables for films, customers, rentals, and more. The dataset provides a rich set of data for practicing SQL queries and exploring database concepts.

## Contents

This repository includes the following:

1. **SQL Queries:** A set of SQL scripts covering a range of topics, including:

   - Retrieving data from tables
   - Aggregating and summarizing data
   - Joining multiple tables
   - Modifying and updating records
   - Creating and altering database objects

## Getting Started

To get started with these SQL scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install PostgreSQL:** If you haven't already, install PostgreSQL on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

3. **Load the Dataset:** Import the DVD rental dataset into your PostgreSQL database. You can use tools like `pg_restore` or a GUI tool like pgAdmin for this purpose.

4. **Explore and Execute:** Dive into the SQL scripts in this repository. You can use a PostgreSQL client or command-line tool to execute the queries against your local database.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with these SQL scripts:

1. Retrieve a list of all rented movies in a given month.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated by the store over a specific period.
3. Find the top-rated films based on customer reviews.

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts to suit your learning needs.
